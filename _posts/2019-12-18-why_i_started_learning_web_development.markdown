My journey into web development started when I was quite randomly picking the brain of a recruitment professional. The question I asked was: What is the one skill you would recommend I learn to improve my chances in building a good career? 

My motivation for asking this question was the fact that I had recently started feeling like my job was leading nowhere. I had been working in hospitality, bars and restaurants, for a long time. While I always enjoyed my work, this year I had started to feel like something was missing. I'm a person who enjoys always feeling like i'm growing and learning new things and I felt like in my job there was nothing new to learn anymore. There was no progress. I wanted to work with something that I felt like I could build a career in.

This person replied that everyone should learn coding these days. "Every company is an IT company" she said. I was sceptical but i gave it a go. I started learning on my own whenever I had time. I quickly fell in love with the way I was constantly making things. It felt very crafty. This surprised me since I always thought of programming as something much more theoretical. Perhaps the term "computer science" mislead me. 

Studying online felt comfortable and safe. I had been taking Open University modules here and there and liked the independence of being able to study from anywhere. I mainly did chemisty and biology courses. I liked them, but they were heavily theoretical and the maker mentality of programming appealed to me so much. I felt like that's exacly what had been missing from my studies. 

Eventually, after learning a few beginner concepts in programming on my own, it became harder to determine what should I learn next? It's hard to know whether you're learning the right things when you're self teaching. I really felt like I could benefit from a more structured curriculum. That's why I applied to Flatiron school, and I'm so excited to be starting my journey now!
