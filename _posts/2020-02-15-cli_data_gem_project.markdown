First project done! I actually can't believe I have managed to finish this. Starting out I felt like there's no way I'm cabable of building a working program (a super simple one but still). But I'm grateful for this challenge because I learned A LOT! Throwing yourself headfirst into actually building something seems like a really efficient way to learn!

I explored many ideas for what I could built. And actually attempted building two different projects before finally arriving at the project I ended up finishing. My first one was an app that would list the most popular travel destinations for 2020 and give the user more information on them. But I ran into major problems when trying to scrape this website. Seems like not all (or maybe not even most) webpages are suitable for scraping. At least with my skill level. 

So I tried another idea. I decided to list flight deals instead. I very useful idea I imagined! Who isn't looking for a flash deal to book a last minute holiday or just find some major savings in a flight they have to book anyway! This time I managed to scrape some information but ended up with a string that seemed impossible to split. Waisted a whole day fighting regex that would do the job. At the end of the day I had a way-too-long piece of regex that still didn't logically split my information. So I scrapped the idea and decided to do something ay more simple. I wanted to focus on building a well working program and keep it as simple as possible at first. I could maybe add to it later, but for now I just wanted to have see this project through.

So I started to build a simple application that shows the user some cities and the user can choose one to see the current weather in this city. I managed to scrape this successfully, and build a logical CLI experience. I did struggle with an if loop for my CLI class for a while but finally got it to work the way I wanted. 

While I imagined building something a bit more complex and cooler when I started, but I'm still very proud of finishing this project! And with the skills I gained along the way I'm sure my next project will be even better! Onwards and upwards..
